# Vulnerability-Assessment-Report

## Description
The server hardware comprises a robust CPU processor and 128GB of memory, operating on the latest version of the Linux operating system. Hosting a MySQL database management system, maintains a stable network connection through IPv4 addresses, facilitating interaction with other servers on the network. Security measures are implemented, including Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypted connections.

## Scope
The vulnerability assessment pertains to the existing access controls within the system, covering a three-month period from June 2023 to January 2024. Guidance from NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is employed to conduct the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose
The database server serves as a centralized computer system responsible for storing and managing extensive datasets, including customer, campaign, and analytic data. This data is subsequently analyzed to monitor performance and tailer marketing efforsts. Given its integral role in marketing operations, securing the system is imperative.

## Approach
The measured risks took into account the data storage and management procedures of the business. Potential threats sources and event were identified based on the likelihood of a security incident occuring, considering the open access permissions of the information system. Severity of potential inciedents was assessed against their impact on day to day operational requirements.
